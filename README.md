# 📘 Final Project - Bachelor's Degree

## 💧 Artificial Intelligence Applied to Water Management  
### 📍 Case Study: Beni Mellal-Khénifra Region, Morocco

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project applies **machine learning** techniques to forecast the **availability of drinking water** in the **Beni Mellal-Khénifra** region. The aim is to support sustainable water management through data-driven predictions.

The project is developed as part of a Bachelor's degree in water and environmental sciences and includes:

- 📄 A written report  
- 💻 A functional prototype/model  
- 🧑‍🏫 A final presentation  

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Collect and analyze hydrological, climatic, and socio-economic data.
- Develop a machine learning model to predict drinking water availability.
- Evaluate model performance with metrics such as RMSE and R².
- Create visualizations and (optionally) a dashboard to demonstrate results.
- Propose recommendations for regional water planning based on predictions.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** R  
- **Packages:** 
  - `tidyverse` – data wrangling and visualization
  - `caret` or `tidymodels` – ML workflow
  - `randomForest`, `xgboost`, `rpart` – algorithms
  - `shiny` (optional) – dashboard for visualization

---

## 📊 Prediction Goal

The core goal is to **predict monthly or seasonal drinking water availability** based on:

- Climate data (rainfall, temperature)
- Water production or storage data (reservoir levels, extraction rates)
- Population or demand indicators

## 📁 Data Sources (Planned)

| Data Type             | Source |
|----------------------|--------|
| Rainfall, Temperature | [CHIRPS](https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps), [NASA POWER](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/) |
| Hydrology (dams, reservoirs) | [ABH Oum Er-Rbia](http://www.abh-ouerra.com/) |
| Population/Demand     | [HCP Morocco](https://www.hcp.ma) |
| Water Infrastructure  | [ONEE](https://www.one.org.ma/) (if accessible) |

## 🔄 Project Steps

1. **Define prediction goal** – availability of drinking water
2. **Collect datasets** – rainfall, temperature, population, etc.
3. **Clean & explore data** – remove outliers, check for missing values
4. **Train machine learning models** – try different algorithms
5. **Evaluate & compare** – choose the best model
6. **Prototype interface** (optional) – create a dashboard using R Shiny
7. **Write report and prepare presentation**

## 📌 Region: Beni Mellal-Khénifra

- Located in central Morocco
- Known for agricultural activity and growing water needs
- Subject to seasonal variation in rainfall and temperature
- Data availability may vary by province (e.g., Beni Mellal, Azilal, Fquih Ben Salah…)

---

## ✅ Deliverables

- 📄 Final written report (academic format)
- 📊 Working prototype (R script or dashboard)
- 🎤 PowerPoint presentation for defense

---

## 🧠 Next Steps

- [ ] Collect climate and population data
- [ ] Clean and prepare dataset in R
- [ ] Train and evaluate models
- [ ] Create visuals for report and slides
